                Javascript is a programming language that is used for writing scripts on the website. Javascript can only be run in the browsers. It is basically used on the client-side. Javascript is capable enough to add HTML and play with the DOM. Javascript can run in any browser engine as like JS core in safari and Spidermonkey in Firefox.

                <span className='text-xl font-bold text-gray-900'>Node js: </span>
                 Nodejs is a Javascript engine that you can write any application you want with (by programming in the Javascript language). It runs your Javascript code. Most commonly, it is used to build servers that can respond to web requests, though it can be used for lots of other types of code too.

                <span className='text-xl font-bold text-gray-900'>MongoDB: </span>
                MongoDB is a database engine. Code within some application or server uses MongoDB to save, query or update data in a database. There are many web servers built with nodejs that will then use MongoDB for storing data.

                These databases have fixed or static or predefined schema. These databases are not suited for hierarchical data storage. These databases are best suited for complex queries. Vertically Scalable.

                They have dynamic schema. These databases are best suited for hierarchical data storage. These databases are not so good for complex queries. Horizontally scalable.

                <span className='text-xl font-bold text-gray-900'>JWT: </span>
                JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.
